### Hello there 👋

My name is Kyle, and I'm a Principal Technical Artist at a mobile game studio in Toronto.   I spend most of my workday 

- 🛠 developing tools for the Narrative, Animation and Art teams, 
- 🖼 Architecting beautiful features,
- 👨‍🔧 managing the asset pipeline, 
- 👨‍💻 managing the members of the Technical Art team,
- 📏 and profiling our game.  

When I manage to avail myself of some free time, I try to dive into topics that don't come up as often during my day job.  You can take a look at some of my favourite projects below.  

In 2022, I'm hoping to

- 🐦 continue building something neat with my friends at [Boss Chamber](https://twitter.com/boss_chamber),
- 🎥 keep experimenting with 3D in Blender: Sculpting, Rigging, Retopology and Geometry Nodes,
- 🦀 and keep things fresh by building a [Roguelike in Godot](https://twitter.com/_KPDwyer/status/1438324255092056064)
