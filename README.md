### Hello there 👋

My name is Kyle, and I'm a Technical Artist / UI Developer / Team Lead at a mobile game studio in Toronto.   I spend most of my workday 

- 🛠 developing tools, 
- 🖼 Architecting beautiful features,
- 👨‍🔧 managing the asset pipeline, 
- 👨‍💻 managing the team,
- 📏 and profiling our game.  

When I manage to avail myself of some free time, I try to dive into topics that don't come up as often during my day job.  You can take a look at some of my favourite projects below.  

In 2021, I'm hoping to

- 🐦 Continue building something neat with my friends at [Boss Chamber](https://www.twitch.tv/bosschamber),
- 🎥 Keep experimenting with 3D - mostly volumetric modelling & retopology,
- 🗺 Create, support and update more [RLBits](https://github.com/KPDwyer/rlbits-mapping), my modular Unity tools for building Roguelikes,
- 🦀 and keep dogfooding my RLBits tools by chipping away at my hobby roguelike.
- 🖊 Bonus:  I'm hoping to write a few more blog posts on [my blog](https://kpdwyer.github.io/)
