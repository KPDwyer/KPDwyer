### Hello there 👋

My name is Kyle, and I'm a Senior Developer at a game studio in Toronto.   I spend most of my workday 

- 🛠 developing tools for the Animation and Art teams, 
- 👨‍🔧 managing the asset pipeline, 
- 👨‍💻 writing code,
- 📏 and profiling & optimizing our game.  

When I manage to avail myself of some free time, I try to dive into topics that don't come up as often during my day job.  You can take a look at some of my favourite projects below.  

In 2023, I'm hoping to

- 🦀 keep things fresh by building a [Roguelike in Godot](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@KPD/109600542593786415),
- 🎥 keep experimenting with 3D in Blender: Sculpting, Rigging, Retopology and Geometry Nodes
- 💀 continue exploring opportunities with my friends at [Boss Chamber](https://twitter.com/boss_chamber),
